DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

Topic: Hybrid - best and worst
Location: Farrand Board
Attendees: 14 total, plus a handful of "bumblebees" - Heidi Waterhouse, Fen Aldrich, Hannah Foxwell, Kevin Reedy (Chicago), Gomex (Salvador - Brasil)

Questions:
  - What makes hybrid work?

      - There are some ~functional~ tools for presentations

    - But open spaces are hard to make hybrid, technologically

    - also there's a lot of attrition from in-person afternoon attendance

    - maybe do fun things on the second day, to try to keep some people sticking around

    - workaround (DoD Rio) focus on one open space/use mic/use the same as livestream

    - use the livechat to pop questions/comments up from the online commenters

    - maybe there are things to do to have separate events


    If we put a lot of efforts in hybrid events for small events, it's very difficult, maybe it would be better to spend efforts on in-person small events in-person. Instead of investing in expensive technology, get in-person attendence at smaller regional stuff.


    Watch parties as a thing to watch the livestream of the event, discuss sessions in that group, with their own open spaces (virtual open spaces can be really hard to pull off)


    When budget is an issue, strip down the extras of your in-person (swag, shirts etc are no need-to-have).


    Is there any data on local/distributed remote attendees?

    - maybe the people who dip out of open spaces are the same ones who only watch the livestream


    Networking is a vital part of the open spaces/community building


    Can't be conclusive about this since the world changed, but the people who'll join you remotely are not cannabilizing the amount of people who'll


Notes:

- Wait, maybe open spaces are hard overall
- Networking is a vital part of the open spaces/community building
- Livestream and in-person events are totally different experiences, and hybridizing is the hard part
- Discord voicechat is more engaging than text chatting
- SREcon as a good example -- all audience questions submitted by slack and prioritized. Making it permissible to have your screens open and engaging, even if you're in person.
- deserted island devops in animal crossing was difficult since you couldn't advance your slides and emote yourself using your Nintendo Switch at the same time
- PyconAU 2020  you could see people responding in reactjis(?) https://2020.pycon.org.au/program/WAY9J7/
- Kevin: tap into this network for help moderating your Open Spaces - people will help!
- Stream lag is a thing, trying to be cute with a chose-your-adventure type talk or polls, you'll need to wait 20/30 secs and it's AWKWARD

    - Or if you're trying to add accessibility features with captioning... Talk to @kevinreedy or the A/V Open Space later

- Charge for online-only? Probably not.
- Do we need to share knowledge/experience?

Action Items:
   - Working Group for Hybrid/virtual event

       - Regional?

    - Communication over Slack and online office hours
