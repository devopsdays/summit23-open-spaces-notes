DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

Topic: Sponsor Cont(r)acts
Location: Adams Studio
Attendees: 12

Notes:
 - Should we have sponsor contracts?
    - 1 page is sufficient
    - As a sponsor, I want one
    - Prospectus plus some binding language
    - Is this still a good idea without making people personally liable?
    - Everyone agrees that there should be something in writing to establish expectations.
    - Can we put some sample contracts on the web site as examples
    - Individuals without legal entities should not sign contracts but stating the expectations is still a good idea
    - When sponsors cancel it is common to try to resell their spot otherwise keep the money
    - Only three hands went up when asked when asked if your city sends contracts by default
    - Some send if asked
    - It's a great idea to put expectations on the invoice so it is coupled with their payment

 - Ideas on how to get more sponsors
   - Offer an even more expensive package, platinum.  It makes gold seem more attractive
   - Just get all your money from New Relic
   - Start early (1 year in advance)
   - Keep hitting them until they say no
   - Follow up when they say their fiscal year rolls over
   - Most companies have an annual sponsorship plan so asking late won't work
   - Some sponsors don't know how to spend small amounts of money ($10k and above is sometimes easier to do)
   - Discount for paying earlier helped drive sales
   - Regional pricing, give discounts to sponsors that sponsor multiple cities
   - Slack channel to share sponsor contacts
