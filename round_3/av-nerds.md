DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

Topic: A/V Nerds
Location: Miller Board Room

Attendees:

Fen: Ran AV for digital at Boston for

AV, Venue, Costs are top three

Geneva:  We used a school

NYC: We used a school and it was a mistake.  The AV had no sense of urgency.  Also they demanded weird things with our insurance.  With few organizers, this was a pain.  Took over so much time.

Geneva: We made a contract where we accepted 50 students to the conference for free.  Offered them a way to shine.  Only requirement was using their catering system

Dave: Engagement might depend on how much they want to be engaged (ie: doing it because they're forced to)

Fen: What A/V specific questions do they have?

NYC: Austin is unhinged and owns their own A/V stuff.

Dealing with live captions is a huge pain

ConFreaks:
    * They have done lots of livestream, lots of experience
    * Offloaded stuff we can do ourselves, but pay them to do it

Lots of A/V vendors can help with livestreaming

Lots of speakers demand their own HDMI:
    * Our HDMI to the podium was prohibitively expensive

Confidence monitors:
    * AV who deal with corporate events should know what to do
    * Gotta include it in the contract
    * We pay them to deal with the nightmare legacy situations of any venue and figure it out
    * They have basic requirements
    * We've had both positive and negative experiences

Hartford:
    * We got lucky in that our A/V knew what to do
    * Another year, we used a concert venue and it was a nightmare

NYC:
    * School theaters are a nightmare as far as projection

Making connections:
    Caterers know people, places, and things

Need to have someone delegated to work with them one-on-one.

Internet issues with livestreaming

Seattle: Assumptions about what we got pre-pandemic

PROTIP: Make sure all your audio streams to web don't get any copyrighted material.  It could get taken down now or even in the future

Audio is hard
  CHI:
      In chicago there's an audio union, so we can't self-handle
      Rabbit hole of gear.  With lots of streamers, there are kits to get started quickly
      OBS (Open Broadcast Studio) is great until it's not.  A couple cameras
      Streamlabs is a competitor
      Blackmagic ATEM Mini -- Video/Sound switcher.  4 HDMI in, 1 HDMI out.  4 Buttons to switch.  Also has ethernet to livestream
      Now

Do we need a devopsdays "how to A/V" guide or even a hardware kit?
  NYC: If you need a useful idiot, i'm here
  Unknown unknowns are really difficult
  Larger orgs could
  Carry-on size pellican case for how to get started

Consider having multiple inputs for your different slides.  A single laptop rotating sponsor slides all day goes a long way.

Live Captioning is HARD
* WhiteCoat captioning -- Amazing, spectacular, sideloaded multiple dictionaries of jargon
  * Just use them.
  * They capture tone, "generalized laughter"
  * You also
  * Book them EARLY.  They will get their devopsdays folks to go.

Rent a device to save captions to video
* KEVIN: The name of this device is EEG iCap Encode Pro (HD492) - This will require some extra technical know-how, but will allow to have captions on screen in the space and embedded in the video stream for YouTube and similar when paired with a Blackmagic Web Presenter
