DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

Topic: DEI efforts and how to move the needle
Location: Wacker
Attendees: Paula, Hannah, Lesley, Rex, Sumit, Corey, Jos, Sasha, Paul


Questions:
  - Does diversity of organisers influence the diversity of audience / attendees?
  - How do we attract more diverse organisers?
  - How do organisers get selected / how do current DevOpsDays events search for new speakers?
  - How can DevOpsDays be more accessible for more junior folks? How do we prevent gate-keeping?
  - How can we avoid putting more pressure on marginalised peopled?
  - Do other events track audience diversity?
  - Where does the Code of Condiuct start and end? (pre-event / post event)
  - should there be a "deny" list of people who have demonstrated poor behaviour? Could we / should we keep a record of code of conduct violations?
  - how do we enforce Code of Conduct?


Notes:
   - As an industry, our diversity is already bad - it is a problem bigger than just DevOpsDays.
   - on-boarding of new organisers is critical to make sure they are part of the committee
   - it is important to create opportunities, allow people automony to decide if they are overburdened, it is nicer to be asked than not asked!
   - we should stive to make sure that the opportunity is greater than the burden
   - we need to ensure the underrepresented organisers are set up for success, not set up as scapegoats for failure!
   - diversity of audience - we all need to keep trying, we need to be specific about what we need and embrace the uncomfortable convesrsations
   - whilst we strive for DevOpsDays to be safe spaces, we can never make promises that a space is definitely safe, we can only guarantee to try to make a space safe
   - context on code of conduct violations is important.
   - we need to hold ourselves accountable


Action Items:
   - Someone needs to pick up the tab at dinner
