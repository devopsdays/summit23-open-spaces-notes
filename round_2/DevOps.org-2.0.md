Crimes with Hugo
Visibly Dated
Not an Ideal Experience

We're talking about replacing with Actual CMS - Joomla which is free and open source

Good
- I like that it's static
- I like that I can build on the train
-


Jooomla  - Kat had 400 contributors - for the US Fencing Coaches association
We'd like to have more data driven activies, instead of statically redefined.

BOS - A lot of us aren't coders, its hard to get started

Optimizing for humans not for engineers

KC - There are way to address these.

Bad
- takes forever to build
- stuff is broken

I can't contribute back to the site, because I've put work on Matty.  Matty is single-threaded.

??? - has a PR to move everyting that's a static asset into a static storage.

assets.devopsdays.org can easily be moved , but to where and who would pay for it.

Website gets a shit ton of traffic. Is there an infra problem or a user experience  --you can go to GH and add a file without having to clone a repo.

City specific user accounts per devopsdays would

Supports single sign with Google and Joomla.

Right now we don't know who's who for commits.
