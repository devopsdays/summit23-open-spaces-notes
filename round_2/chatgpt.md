DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

Topic: ChatGPT infecting the CFP
Location: HUB
Attendees: Grimace, Ronald McDonald, Hamburglar

Donald: Some people use GPT to send all message, don't penalize them

Jason: Some people propose talks that sound great, but don't payoff.  How do you deal with speakers that don't deliver?

Get a preview of their slides before they go on stage.  Get their slides 2 weeks early

Peter: But what if their slides are terrible?

JJ: Before we accept the talks, we have office hours to talk about their abstract.  If they miss that time, we offer another after the talks are accepted.

Jason: Tel Aviv does "if we accept your talk and you agree, we have specific due dates for slides, dry runs"
Sasha: I hate that...
Charles: Do you hate it enough to bail?
Sasha: Maybe, if you didn't tell me before

JJ: Every talk that showed up to the office hours was accepted.  All of them were completely new speakers.  It helps with the pipeline

Paul:  Would it be useful to say you _must_ attend an "office hours"
Sasha: I'm not even thinking about the event then.
Paul: But then you'll self-select people out of the process
Sasha: Won't that then create an exclusive situation?

Seasoned speakers:
    Sometimes good, sometimes bad.
    * Consider half/half seasoned, new
    * Donald:  The best talk we ever had was someone who wasn't a seasoned speaker, but was still a known quantity; but if we hassled him before, he would have bailed.

Some things we've cought during dry runs:
    * Ceren: Problematic slides; get it early during a dry run.  Often a week or two before.  The value is in the small stuff.

Consensus: Dry runs are a great idea.  Provide a clear timeline before CFP due date

Ceren: If anything, our environment is stale with recycled proposals.  Plenty of people have aspirations, but not the personal expertise.  Concerned with stale content being exaccerbated by ChatGPT

What about interviews?
* Lots of work

Scrap the Double-Blind
* Who you are matters, too
* ChatGPT might throw the whole concept in the bin
* First pass through is blind, then we go back; we don't go through with a fine tooth comb.  "Best of 3" sessionize feature

Are any events requesting a video beforehand?
* JJ: If i had to do that, i'd never submit a talk
* Jason: A lot of conferences are requesting

Paul: What if your CFP was audition style
* JJ: That's a ton of time
* Ceren: Doesn't need to be everyone viewing

Refer people to your local conference meetup
*
Maybe one of three things
* 5 minute video
*

Is this really a problem?
* Some companies give promotions based on number of talks submitted
* Some amount of people would accept that talk and give a half-[efforted] one

Sharone: You want to give as much time as possible to new people to get their CFP setup

AUSTIN: First year speakers give the best talks

Sharone: Mentorship -- We give tons of support for lots of people.  It gets us checks along the way.  It takes an extremely committed team.  Program committe is a commitment.  Two days of public speaking training.  Included in our budget.

Tap into community resources as well; Women On Stage trains women speakers in the community. womenonstage.net
