DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO START A SLACK HUDDLE SO THAT REMOTE PEEPS CAN JOIN

Topic: CFPs, how do you ensure quality and diversity and block sales pitches
Location: Hub
Attendees: Grimace, Ronald McDonald, Hamburglar

Questions:
  - How do you keep sales pitches from getting in?

      - CfP open, voting, discussion, selection

    - Take time to have a 1-hour call to discuss theme and intention, only then finalize

    -

  - How do you make sure you have a diverse speaking set?

Notes:
   - Pre-selection CfP office hours
   - Organizers help craft talks
   - 2 month CfP period (or longer), 1 office hr/week
   - Mix of new speakers, known speakers
   - Use meetups as a training ground/feeder system
   - Sessionize leads to more "trash" submissions, and more individual forms add enough friction to reduce that.


Action Items:
   - Someone needs to pick up the tab at dinner
