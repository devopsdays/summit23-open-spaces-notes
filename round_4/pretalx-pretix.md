DevOpsDays Org Summit 2023

PLEASE DO NOT FORGET TO START A SLACK HUDDLE SO THAT REMOTE PEEPS CAN JOIN

Topic: Pretix/Pretalx
Location:
Attendees: Yvo + fans

Notes were added after the session was over, so apologies if I missed anything critical.

TL;DR: Pretix/Pretalx will be available for all devopsdays orgs and can help them get started.

Soon pretix will handle all state-level tax.  It currently handles all European VAT.

Join #conference-services on Core slack to follow along
